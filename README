AutoSPARQL is a graphical user interface, which allows to answer natural
language queries over RDF knowledge bases. It is based on algorithms
implemented in the DL-Learner Semantic Web machine learning framework.
Currently, there are two user interfaces 1.) a full-fledged UI closely
aligned to the unterlying algorithms and 2.) a simple UI which should be
easy to use for anyone.

USAGE
You need to clone the git repository and have Maven and Java installed on your machine. Then you need to do "mvn install -N" in the
folders in that order: autosparql, commons, algorithm-tbsl. Then go into autosparql-tbsl and run "mvn jetty:run".

KNOWN BUGS
Properties may not be handled as symmetric, thus queries such as "movies starred by Brad Pitt" may search only in properties of movies or Brad Pitt and thus miss the correct one, resulting in an empty result. 
The SOLR index is being reworked, in the process there are some NER problems in DBpedia.
