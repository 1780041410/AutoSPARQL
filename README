AutoSPARQL is a graphical user interface, which allows to answer natural
language queries over RDF knowledge bases. It is based on algorithms
implemented in the DL-Learner Semantic Web machine learning framework.
Currently, there are two user interfaces 1.) a full-fledged UI closely
aligned to the unterlying algorithms and 2.) a simple UI which should be
easy to use for anyone.

USAGE
You need to clone the git repository and have Maven and Java installed on your machine. Then you need to do "mvn install -N" in the
folders in that order: autosparql, commons, algorithm-tbsl. Then go into autosparql-tbsl and run "mvn jetty:run".

REMARKS
Symmetric properties now properly work again.
