AutoSPARQL is a graphical user interface, which allows to answer natural
language queries over RDF knowledge bases. It is based on algorithms
implemented in the DL-Learner Semantic Web machine learning framework.
Currently, there are two user interfaces 1.) a full-fledged UI closely
aligned to the unterlying algorithms and 2.) a simple UI which should be
easy to use for anyone.

TODO: Provide a nicer README.
