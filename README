AutoSPARQL is a graphical user interface, which allows to answer natural
language queries over RDF knowledge bases. It is based on algorithms
implemented in the DL-Learner Semantic Web machine learning framework.
Currently, there are two user interfaces 1.) a full-fledged UI closely
aligned to the unterlying algorithms and 2.) a simple UI which should be
easy to use for anyone.

USAGE
You need to clone the git repository and have Maven 3 or higher and Java 7 or higher installed on your machine. Then you need to run "./compile" and then "./run" on Linux or "compile.bat" and then "run.bat" on Windows (not tested on Windows, please create an issue if the Windows batch needs rework).
There is also "./createcompillelog" for easier error reporting.

Manually: Do "mvn install -N" in the folders in that order: autosparql, commons, algorithm-tbsl. Then go into autosparql-tbsl and run "mvn jetty:run".

Then, go into your browser and access "http://localhost:8080/autosparql-lite".

REMARKS
Symmetric properties now properly work again.
